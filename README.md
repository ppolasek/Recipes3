# My Favorite Recipes3
Organize all your favorite recipes!

Keep track of:
1. which cookbook your recipe is in and the page number
2. or the URL to your favorite recipe
3. a picture of the prepared dish
4. Notes on what the heck went wrong, or what you had to change
    1. e.g. used different ingredients, or how much

Also:
1. Rate the 'true' effort level to prepare the ingredients and cook the meal
   and the time it took from prep work to completion!

## Technology
Recipes3 uses Node.js with MongoDb for the backend services, while still
retaining the Angular Dart web front-end from Recipes2.

This project was created to demonstrate my use of Node.js with MongoDb,
converting the recipe-server from Spring Boot and MySql.

## Getting Started
#### Install
1. Note: this does require a working install of MongoDb at port 27017.
1. Open a terminal window and navigate to Recipes3.
1. Type 'npm install'.
#### Start
1. From the same terminal window type 'npm start'.
1. If desired, tail the log file recipe-server/logs/recipe_server.log.
#### Web
1. In a browser window enter the URL http://localhost:58731/index.html
